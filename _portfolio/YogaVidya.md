## Design Thinking

###  Analyzing the current website

Reviewing and analyzing the aspects of the current website brought in a lot of problems some of which were really concerning. To provide a background, the website was created before by a 3rd party organization which took the liberty to embed their company website into the copyright line which was a hyperlink to a totally unrelated organization. This went unnoticed for a long time. Additionally most of the functionality was not in a working state and overall there were a lot of performance problems. 

In summary 
- Checkout process is inactive 
- Internal search engine is not configured with metadata or any kind of indexing 
- Copyright link associated with another organization 
- Degraded website performance 
- Website not optimized for search engines

Screenshots of the same are below. 

**1. CheckOut Process**

The Service is inactive

In speed test of the website it was found that images, Third party content, Structure,
open css are causing the issue.

# Stakeholders Interview

Post analysis of the website. I conducted stakeholder interviews. It was to understand and identify the below areas 
- Who are the stakeholders.
- Their philosophy
- Goals of the organization
- Services being provided
- The unique features of the organization, What sets them apart from other competitors
- Privacy Policy
- Terms and Conditions

Above information provided me more context about the organization and also helped me to draw boundaries as per the organization vision mission and goals. 

These are a very important aspect for any UX Designer to accurately know the limits of the work that is expected. 

# User Survey

Qualitative and Quantitative survey is conducted from the current user base. 
Google reviews for the website were also considered to get insight of what were the common problems/queries which users have. This helped in creating problem statement from the users point of view. 

The below image shows the most common questions and issues which need to be addressed. It has also been categorized into groups for the easy understanding of the stakeholders.

# SiteMap

Starting with organizing the sitemap was the first step as google's search engine could crawl and make the search more efficient. This will not only help users to find the institute on google search but, also help the YVN to get boost.

# Mid-fidelity wireframes

For provided stakeholders mid-fidelity wireframes. Below are some that I chose to share, starting with home page as it was  the main task that needs to be covered in general.

#### Call to action on banner for any event or workshop taking place in coming month.

## Wrapping Up

I provided all the final deliverables to the representatives and had sessions to explain my findings and took into account their views and did some more iterations based on it. All the information was then taken into account to be provided to individuals who would further handle the modifications to the website. 


## My Thoughts 

This project helped me grow more as an individual, the interaction with the stakeholders and understanding their views improved my understanding about another side of businesses. As you see the organization is not technology oriented, providing them insight on what is currently possible and also creating design for non avid users of technology gave me a new challenge. This project has been a crucial journey in understanding and bridging boundaries between technology and areas of a different domain of sciences. 

Possibilities of growth and awareness in terms of non profit organizations if taken up really well could result in opening up a vast market and outlook. Eventually enabling users for a better life. As a UX Designer this experience helped me improve my design process and research on a much higher level.
