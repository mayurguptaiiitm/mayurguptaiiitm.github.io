# Discovery Phase

Under the first half of the double Diamond which is the discovery stage, we set to uncover the various problems and opportunities. Setting out the research goals helped us lay out our target.

<!-- ![UserInterview](/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_DiscoveryPhase_3.jpeg) -->
<img src="/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_DiscoveryPhase_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid">

We conducted all interviews via zoom. Conducting interviews with the users helped us gain perspective of the users thoughts and experience. We used various techniques to observe and gain insight to this experience. They gave us excellent insights which we used in our ideation sessions.

<!-- ![Google Analytics](/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_GoogleAnalytics.jpeg) -->
<img src="/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_GoogleAnalytics.jpeg" class="img-fluid">


As per google analytics data, we were able to gain insights that their audience is not limited to only ladies, but, men also are interested in their concept.

Also, data shows us majority of the users view Charrli website via mobile but, shopping is done only via desktop.

<!-- ![Value Proposition](/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_ValueProposition.jpeg) -->
<img src="/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_ValueProposition.jpeg" class="img-fluid">

There were many assumptions by the stakeholder that were validated via User Interview & Data Analysis. For example, people are not price sensitive. They understand the value and trust the quality of the product.

Stakeholders were right about the confusion that their users were facing after the transformation of the business from B2C to B2B2C.

# Defining Phase

We performed affinity mapping- which is a technique used to analysis large data collected during interview into relevant and similar groups. the image is shown below.

# Persona

<!-- ![Persona](/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_Persona.jpeg) -->
<img src="/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_Persona.jpeg" class="img-fluid">

The Persona we created based on the user data represents motivations, pain points, values and influencing/motivating factors of a composite target customer.

# User Journey Map

<!-- ![User Journey Map](/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_UserJourneyMap.jpeg) -->
<img src="/Images/Charlii_Img/CH_UserJourneyMap.jpeg" class="img-fluid">


This is a customer journey map discovered user interviews.

From the Journey Map we can see the product being added to cart without purchases being completed. This is a result of their area not being reachable by Charrli. The current Postal Code Checker is small and usually goes un-noticed. This creates a user perception that the products which are not available in their region should not be shown to them in the listing. 
```
Hence, prompting the user a conclusion that products which are not available to the user’s location should not be shown at all.

Based on our Persona and user Journey map we have narrowed down our problems scope to increase customers, basket size and conversion rate.

# Wrapping Up

Whole project was conducted online, from stakeholder interview to user interview and from ideation and prototyping with team to usability testing. Everything turned out very well with satisfied stakeholders.

# My Views

Initiatives like Charrli also gained fame and and many other similar businesses like it in UK started up over the years. eg Dabba Drop which introduced returnable takeaways. My work in the project helped the business identify and improve on the aspects where technology could empower businesses with innovative ideas and enable them to grow their reach to increase business as well as environment care. 

The idea which was started by Charrli and with its success has enabled more environment friendly initiatives to come up with the support of consumers and increased awareness over global environment health. 

My project is a strong example of how a proper User Experience when amalgamated with a social cause strengthens the overall reach and impact of any idea. With my designs I have always aimed for achieving greater success and improved customer satisfaction which results in a healthy and stronger business growth.
