We conducted all interviews via zoom. Conducting interviews with the users helped us gain perspective of the user experience. We used various techniques to observe and gain insight to this experience. They gave us excellent insights which we used in our ideation sessions.

As per google analytics data, we were able to gain insights that their audience is not limited to only ladies, but, men also are interested in their concept.

Also, data shows most users view your website via mobile but, shopping is done only via desktop.

![Value Proposition](Charlii_Img/CH_ValueProposition.jpeg)

There were many assumptions by the stakeholder that were validated via User Interview & Data Analysis. For example, people are not price sensitive. They understand the value and trust the quality the product.

Stakeholders were right about the confusion that their users were facing after the transformation of the business from B2C to B2B2C.

![Affinity Mapping](Charlii_Img/CH_AffinityMapping.jpeg)


We performed affinity mapping- which is a technique used to analysis large data collected during interview into relevant and similar groups.

# Persona

![Persona](Charlii_Img/CH_Persona.jpeg)

The Persona represents motivations, pain points, values and influences of a composite target customer.

# User Journey Map

![User Journey Map](Charlii_Img/CH_UserJourneyMap.jpeg)


This is a customer journey map discovered user interviews.

From the Journey Map we can see the product being added to cart without purchases being completed. This is usually as a result of their area not being reachable by Charrli. The current Post Code Checker is small and usually goes unnoticeable. Hence, prompting the conclusion that products which are not available to the userâ€™s location should not be shown at all.

![Scope Comparision](Charlii_Img/CH_ScopeComparision.jpeg)

Based on our Persona and user Journey map we have narrowed down our problems scope to increase customers, basket size and conversion rate.
